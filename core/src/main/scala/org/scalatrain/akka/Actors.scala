/**
 * Actor guaranties messages delivery order.
 *
 * State, Behavior, Mailbox
 *
 * at-most-once delivery, i.e. no guaranteed delivery
 * message ordering per senderâ€“receiver pair
 *
 * at-most-once
 * at-least-once
 * exactly-once
 *
 * http://www.infoq.com/articles/no-reliable-messaging
 *
 * Actor A1 sends messages M1, M2, M3 to A2
 * Actor A3 sends messages M4, M5, M6 to A2

 * If M1 is delivered it must be delivered before M2 and M3
 * If M2 is delivered it must be delivered before M3
 * If M4 is delivered it must be delivered before M5 and M6
 * If M5 is delivered it must be delivered before M6
 * A2 can see messages from A1 interleaved with messages from A3
 * Since there is no guaranteed delivery, any of the messages may be dropped, i.e. not arrive at A2
